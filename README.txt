uhhhhhh the questions/prompts are pretty straightword, just answer the prompts like they say
if you want you can take the .exe and put it where you desire and add it to your path so you can call it
fair warning, same skins are pretty rare so if you search something that isnt on the market cause its too expensive or rare, you wont get a price back

(Dont worry about knives needing the star, thats handled automatically, just enter yes in your prompt, same for StatTrak stuff)
